# this is an example level file
# '#' defines a comment line
# the format is as follows:
#
# FLOOR_HEIGHT - height of the floor is given as an integer value
# ROOM1_WIDTH | ROOM_OBJECT1_TYPE, DATA_PIECE1 , ..., OBJECT_ROOM_COORDINATES | ROOM_OBJECT2_TYPE, ...etc - each object in a room is deliniated by the '|' symbol
# ROOM2... - each line is a new room on the floor
# ROOM3...
# FLOOR_END - to indicate the end of a floor's data; this MUST BE at the END of EVERY FLOOR! (or it will crash the game)
#
# each object in a room is given as pieces of data separated by a ','
# all coordinates are relative to the room's position; (0,0) is the bottom left corner of the room the object is in
# doors/vents: door/vent, wall_door_is_on(right, left, top ,bot), position_of_door_on_wall(a single integer value, higher = to the right / to the top of wall)
# stairs: stair, pair_number(an integer that indicates which other stairway it is linked to), type(A or B, each pair of stairs must have one A and one B), x_coordinate, y_coordinate
# items/objects/enemies: item/object/enemy, type(what subclass it is), x_coordinate, y_coordinate
# player: player, x_coordinate, y_coordinate
